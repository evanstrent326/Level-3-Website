		<h2><u>A breif description/history of GNU/Linux.</u></h2>
		
		<h4><u>What is GNU/Linux?</u></h4>
		<p>GNU/Linux is an operating system, which is a large piece of software that manages a computer.
		It is similar to Windows, but it is entirely free and open source.
		The accurate name is GNU/Linux but "Linux" is used more often.</p>

		<h4><u>Who created GNU/Linux and what is the history of its creation?</u></h4>
		<p>GNU/Linux was created by a lot of people around the globe as a part of the GNU/Linux community, but there some people and Organisations
			that are promient in the creation, evolution and maintaning of GNU/Linux. One of them is called Linus Torvalds he ceated the original
			Linux kernel and contributed and still contributes a lot to the Linux kernel. Richard Stallman and the GNU project developed the GNU operating
			system from 1984 until the early 90's, but they were still missing a core piece of the puzzle... The kernel! Which is where the Linux kernel
			came in once it was made free software, from there on they became the GNU/Linux project.</p>

		<h4><u>What is a distribution?</u></h4>
		<p>A version of the Linux operating system and its related components. A Linux distribution includes the Linux kernel, software modules from the GNU Project,
			an installation program, desktop enviroment (user interface), window manager(normally included inside the desktop enviroment), utilities, applications and documentation.
			Some distributions contain a thousand or more files.
			Linux distributors may offer both free and paid versions, whereby the free version comprises an older kernel, fewer utilities and support only via
			online documentation and forums. For example, Red Hat's Fedora is free but without support. Paid versions include the latest modifications
			and software with a full tech support program.</p>

		<h4><u>Why is there so many Linux distributions to choose from?</u></h4>
		<p>One reason has to do with the GNU license that Linux is released under the GNU license. Anyone is free to copy, modify, and distribute Linux as they see fit. Take any existing distro and
			change the wallpaper and branding a little bit and bingo a new distribution is born.</p>
		<p>It’s not illegal, even though it’s tasteless and tacky. While the GNU license is wonderful because it facilitates a worldwide community of contributors to make Linux awesome,
			it also has the unintended consequence of enabling some people to “plagiarize” the work of others and release it under their own brand.</p>
